# CMSC472 Assignment 2

For Assignment 2, you will use hw2.ipynb to create a two-layer neural network from scratch. You will implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks to build a neural network that performs image and text classification.  By completing this assignment you will:

- Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.

- Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.

- Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.

## Getting Started

You will work on this assignment in Google Colab. To get our starter notebook in colab, you can either download it here, and upload there, or you can:

1. File -> Open Notebook -> Github
2. Set user `mgwillia`
3. Set repository `https://github.com/mgwillia/CMSC472_2021_HW2`
4. Select `hw2.ipynb`
5. Select `Copy to Drive` to create your own copy, where you will do your work.

Be careful: there are a few explaination questions asked which needs to be answered apart from the coding questions. Make sure to read everything, and complete all exercises.

## Submission

Submission needs to be done on Gradescope. Upload the iPython notebook to Google Drive if you were not working in Colab already. Now, get the share link for the iPython notebook and embed it inside the notebook (you can do this by opening the notebook on the drive using Google Colab). Do not forget to give view access on this link!

Please generate a PDF from the iPython notebook and upload it to Gradescope. Please make sure that the PDF contains the link to the Google Drive share otherwise the assignment may not be graded. Additionally, make sure the PDF shows all code and relevant outputs. Missing code and missing outputs in the PDF will be treated as incomplete and points will be deducted accordingly. Make sure to complete question selection in Gradescope; we will deduct points at our discretion if question-answer pairs are not properly indicated. 

## Deadline

Assignment 2 is due on Feb 28 at 5:00 PM.  

## Notes

None of the parts of this assignment require use of a machine with a GPU or Pytorch library. You may complete the assignment using your local machine or you may use Google Colaboratory. However, we encourage you to try using Google Colaboratory and get familiar with it as it would be helpful in upcoming assignments.

Credits: The format of this assignment is inspired by the Stanford CS231n assignments. We have borrowed some of their data loading and instructions in our assignment ipython notebook.
